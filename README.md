# Snake-Game-Console-without-graphics.h
### Snake Game Console build in C language but without ``graphics.h`` header

This is the simple snake game that run on windows console/command prompt/CMD without using graphic library or ``graphic.h`` for display the graphic thing on C language.
The main idea is to make movement of the snake using looping and every loop, the coordinate of the snake and it's tail is different sequencially.
This snake game is build just using the basic syntax of the C language without any special syntax from another C library.
